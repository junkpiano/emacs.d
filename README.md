# .emacs.d

This is my personal emacs configuration.

## Usage

    git clone https://github.com/junkpiano/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

## Notes

If you still want to use Emacs, or are willing to start using Emacs from now, I recommend you to use [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org). That's pretty good, and doesn't require any hassle for configuration *hell*.
